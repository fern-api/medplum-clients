# Medplum Clients

The Fern API spec lives [here](./api/fhir.yml). This was autogenerated from the Medplum OpenAPI spec.
Checkout the generated FHIR Java client by running the following commands.

## Java Client

The Java client lives inside of the folder [medplum-java](./api/med).  

Run ```./gradlew idea && open *.ipr``` to open in Intellij. 

Build the project to generate [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io/) classes.  

Checkout the [sample app](./medplum-java/medplum-sample-application/src/main/java/com/sample/Main.java) and write your own code!

## Typescript Client

## Known Limitations

- Enums that are not alphabetic are not currently supported. Tracked [here](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues/62). 
- [fern.sh](/fern.sh) is hardcoded but will eventually be a flexible CLI that can be installed via brew.
